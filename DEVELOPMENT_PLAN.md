## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 State Management Strategy
```swift
// Centralized app state manager
class AppStateManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var mealPlans: [MealPlan] = []
    @Published var recipes: [Recipe] = []
    
    // Proper initialization
    init() {
        loadUserData()
        loadMealPlans()
        loadRecipes()
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Consistent Spacing System
```swift
// Spacing constants for consistent UI
struct Spacing {
    static let xs: CGFloat = 4
    static let sm: CGFloat = 8
    static let md: CGFloat = 16
    static let lg: CGFloat = 24
    static let xl: CGFloat = 32
    static let xxl: CGFloat = 48
}
```

### 3.3 Uniform Widget Sizing
```swift
// Consistent button sizing
struct ButtonSize {
    static let small: CGSize = CGSize(width: 80, height: 32)
    static let medium: CGSize = CGSize(width: 120, height: 44)
    static let large: CGSize = CGSize(width: 160, height: 48)
}
```

### 3.4 Modular Component Structure
