# Development Principles & Guidelines

## Technical Leadership Approach

### 1. Always Ask Clarifying Questions First
- "What's the current repository structure?"
- "What's the intended architecture?"
- "What's the relationship between these components?"
- "Where exactly should this live?"
- "What's the broader context of this change?"

### 2. Think Architecturally, Not Just Tactically
- Map the full system before making changes
- Consider scalability and maintainability
- Design clean, logical structures
- Solve root causes, not symptoms
- Consider the long-term impact of decisions

### 3. Context Before Action
- Understand the current state completely
- Verify assumptions before proceeding
- Consider the broader impact of changes
- Think about the full development workflow
- Map the entire system before making changes

### 4. Execute Once Correctly
- Present a clear plan before executing
- No more trial-and-error file moving
- Single, well-thought-out solution
- Test and verify before considering complete
- Design the solution, then implement

### 5. Communicate My Reasoning
- Explain why I'm choosing a particular approach
- Ask for confirmation on architectural decisions
- Be transparent about uncertainties
- Learn from mistakes and adjust
- Document the reasoning behind decisions

## For NutriPlanr Development

### Focus Areas
- **Build features, not fix file organization**
- **Ask about intended architecture before making structural changes**
- **Think about long-term maintainability of the codebase**
- **Prioritize development velocity and time efficiency**

### Repository Structure Philosophy
- Clean, logical organization
- Scalable for multiple apps
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to navigate and maintain

### Decision Making Process
1. **Gather Context** - Understand current state and requirements
2. **Design Solution** - Think through the architecture
3. **Present Plan** - Explain the approach and reasoning
4. **Execute Once** - Implement the correct solution
5. **Verify Results** - Confirm everything works as intended

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong (File Organization Session)
- Didn't ask clarifying questions about repository structure
- Acted on assumptions without verifying
- Solved symptoms instead of root causes
- Didn't think systematically about the architecture
- Wasted time on trial-and-error instead of proper planning

### How to Avoid in Future
- Always map the current state first
- Ask about intended architecture
- Design the solution before implementing
- Consider the broader system context
- Execute once correctly
