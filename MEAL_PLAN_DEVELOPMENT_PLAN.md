# Meal Plan Assistant - Development Plan

## Version: 1.0
## Date: December 2024
## Status: Planning Phase

---

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development approach for building the **Meal Plan Assistant** app - a proactive nutrition planning application that focuses on planning and execution rather than reactive tracking.

### Core Development Principles
- **Clean, even spacing** throughout the UI using consistent design systems
- **Uniform, consistent widget sizing** for all interactive elements
- **Proper state management and initialization** with MVVM architecture
- **Simple, scalable, and modular** code structure
- **Best practices** for iOS development and UI/UX design

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.1 Architecture Pattern
```swift
// MVVM with centralized state management
class AppStateManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var currentUser: User?
    @Published var currentMealPlan: MealPlan?
    @Published var recipes: [Recipe] = []
    @Published var groceryList: GroceryList?
    
    // Proper initialization with error handling
    init() {
        loadUserData()
        loadCurrentMealPlan()
        loadRecipes()
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Data Flow Architecture
```
User Input → ViewModels → Business Logic → Data Layer → Core Data
    ↓
UI Updates ← State Changes ← ObservableObject ← @Published Properties
```

### 3.3 Consistent Spacing System
```swift
// 8pt grid system for consistent spacing
struct Spacing {
    static let xs: CGFloat = 4   // 0.5x grid
    static let sm: CGFloat = 8   // 1x grid
    static let md: CGFloat = 16  // 2x grid
    static let lg: CGFloat = 24  // 3x grid
    static let xl: CGFloat = 32  // 4x grid
    static let xxl: CGFloat = 48 // 6x grid
}
```

### 3.4 Uniform Widget Sizing
```swift
// Consistent component dimensions
struct ComponentSize {
    static let buttonHeight: CGFloat = 44
    static let cardCornerRadius: CGFloat = 12
    static let inputFieldHeight: CGFloat = 48
    static let mealCardHeight: CGFloat = 120
}
```
